## Overview
This repo contains the .NET Core client library and sample for the Microsoft Face API, an offering within [Microsoft Cognitive Services](https://www.microsoft.com/cognitive-services), formerly known as Project Oxford.

* [Learn about the Face API](https://www.microsoft.com/cognitive-services/en-us/face-api)
* [Read the documentation](https://www.microsoft.com/cognitive-services/en-us/face-api/documentation/overview)
* [Find more SDKs & Samples](https://www.microsoft.com/cognitive-services/en-us/SDK-Sample?api=face)

Before you can use the SDK or run the sample application you must subscribe to the Face API which is part of Microsoft Cognitive Services. You can learn how to subscribe [here](https://www.microsoft.com/cognitive-services/en-us/sign-up).

## The Client Library
The client library is a thin .NET Core client wrapper for the Face API. The easiest way to use this client library is to get the microsoft.projectxoford.face.dotnetcore package from nuget. Please go to the [.NET Core Face API Package in Nuget](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.ProjectOxford.Face.DotNetCore/) for more details.
